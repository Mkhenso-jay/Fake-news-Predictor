# ✅ To-Do After Model Selection

After selecting the best-performing model, follow these steps to finalize, optimize, and deploy the Fake News Predictor.

---

## 1️⃣ Fine-Tune the Model
- [ ] Perform hyperparameter tuning (`GridSearchCV` / `RandomizedSearchCV`) to improve performance.
- [ ] Adjust parameters like:
  - `n_estimators` (number of trees)
  - `max_depth` (tree depth)
  - `min_samples_split` and `min_samples_leaf`
- [ ] Evaluate using cross-validation and select the best configuration.

## 2️⃣ Save the Final Model
- [ ] Save the trained pipeline (TF-IDF + classifier + label encoder) using `joblib`.
- [ ] Ensure the model can be loaded later for predictions without retraining.

## 3️⃣ Evaluate on New Data
- [ ] Test the model on unseen data or a holdout set.
- [ ] Check metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
- [ ] Analyze misclassified samples to identify potential improvements.

## 4️⃣ Build Backend
- [ ] Create a backend API using **Flask** or **FastAPI**.
- [ ] Accept POST requests with news text.
- [ ] Return JSON responses with predicted labels (FAKE/REAL) and confidence scores.

## 5️⃣ Build Frontend
- [ ] **Option A:** Streamlit app for interactive text input and visualization.
- [ ] **Option B:** React frontend connecting to the backend API via `fetch` or `axios`.
- [ ] Display predictions and confidence/probabilities.
- [ ] Optional: Batch predictions via file upload.

## 6️⃣ Deploy the Application
- [ ] Run locally for testing.
- [ ] Optionally, deploy on cloud (Heroku, Render, or Docker container).

## 7️⃣ Documentation & Reporting
- [ ] Document preprocessing steps, model choice, hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics.
- [ ] Provide instructions for running the app locally.
- [ ] Include visualizations and screenshots for presentation.

## 8️⃣ Optional Enhancements
- [ ] Show probabilities for both FAKE and REAL classes using charts.
- [ ] Add dashboard features or integrate APIs for innovation.
- [ ] Improve UI styling and interactivity.
